# knitrhooks

**knitrhooks** provides useful knitr hooks to extend the functionality of knitr, Rmarkdown and bookdown.

## Example

The current functionality provided by this package is to set a maximum height for R output and add a scroll bar to any output larger than a given height.

<pre>
<code>```{r max_width_example}
library(knitrhooks)
max_height()
```</code>

# Example document

<code>```{r max_height = "300px"}
print(mtcars)
```</code>
</pre>

The above code will produce the following HTML document.
